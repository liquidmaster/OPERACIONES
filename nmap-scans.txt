Typical Scanning Session
First, we’ll sweep the network with a simple Ping scan to determine which hosts
are online.
	 nmap -sP 10.0.0.0/24
		Starting Nmap 4.01 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
		Host 10.0.0.1 appears to be up.
		MAC Address: 00:09:5B:29:FD:96 (Netgear)
		Host 10.0.0.2 appears to be up.
		MAC Address: 00:0F:B5:96:38:5D (Netgear)
		Host 10.0.0.4 appears to be up.
		Host 10.0.0.5 appears to be up.
		MAC Address: 00:14:2A:B1:1E:2E (Elitegroup Computer System Co.)
		Nmap finished: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 5.399 seconds

We’ll scan 10.0.0.1 using a SYN scan [-sS] and -A to enable OS fingerprinting
and version detection.
	nmap -sS -A 10.0.0.1
		Starting Nmap 4.01 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
		Insufficient responses for TCP sequencing (0),
		OS detection may be less accurate
		Interesting ports on 10.0.0.1:
		(The 1671 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
		PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
		80/tcp open tcpwrapped
		MAC Address: 00:09:5B:29:FD:96 (Netgear)
		Device type: WAP
		Running: Compaq embedded, Netgear embedded
		OS details: WAP: Compaq iPAQ Connection Point or
		Netgear MR814
		Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 19 3.533 seconds

The only open port is 80/tcp - in this case, the web admin interface for the router. OS fingerprinting guessed it was a Netgear Wireless Access Point - in fact this is a Netgear (wired) ADSL router. As it said, though, there were insufficient responses for TCP sequencing to accurately detect the OS. Now we’ll do the same for 10.0.0.2...

	map -sS -A 10.0.0.2
		Starting Nmap 4.01 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
		Interesting ports on 10.0.0.2:
		(The 1671 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
		PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
		80/tcp open http Boa HTTPd 0.94.11
		MAC Address: 00:0F:B5:96:38:5D (Netgear)
		Device type: general purpose
		Running: Linux 2.4.X|2.5.X
		OS details: Linux 2.4.0 - 2.5.20
		Uptime 14.141 days (since Fri Jun 30 11:03:05 2006)
		Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 9.636 seconds

Now we’ll move on to 10.0.0.4 and 10.0.0.5, these are likely to be normal
computers running on the network...

	nmap -sS -P0 -A -v 10.0.0.4
	Starting Nmap 4.01 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
	DNS resolution of 1 IPs took 0.10s. Mode:
	Async [#: 2, OK: 0, NX: 1, DR: 0, SF: 0, TR: 1, CN: 0]
	Initiating SYN Stealth Scan against 10.0.0.4 [1672 ports] at 14:31
	Discovered open port 21/tcp on 10.0.0.4
	Discovered open port 22/tcp on 10.0.0.4
	Discovered open port 631/tcp on 10.0.0.4
	Discovered open port 6000/tcp on 10.0.0.4
	The SYN Stealth Scan took 0.16s to scan 1672 total ports.
	Initiating service scan against 4 services on 10.0.0.4 at 14:31 The service scan took 6.01s to scan 4 services on 1 host.For OSScan assuming port 21 is open, 1 is closed, and neither are firewalled
	Host 10.0.0.4 appears to be up ... good.
	Interesting ports on 10.0.0.4:
	(The 1668 ports scanned but not shown below are in state: closed)
	PORT STATE SERVICE VERSION
	21/tcp open ftp vsftpd 2.0.3
	22/tcp open ssh OpenSSH 4.2 (protocol 1.99)
	631/tcp open ipp CUPS 1.1
	6000/tcp open X11 (access denied)
	Device type: general purpose
	Running: Linux 2.4.X|2.5.X|2.6.X
	OS details: Linux 2.4.0 - 2.5.20, Linux 2.5.25 - 2.6.8 or Gentoo 1.2 Linux 2.4.19 rc1-rc7
	TCP Sequence Prediction: Class=random positive increments Difficulty=4732564 (Good luck!)
	IPID Sequence Generation: All zeros Service Info: OS: Unix
	Nmap finished: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 8.333 seconds Raw packets sent: 1687 (74.7KB) | Rcvd: 3382 (143KB)

	The -v option is needed to get Nmap to print the IPID information out! Now, onto 10.0.0.5...
	nmap -sS -P0 -A -v 10.0.0.5
	Starting Nmap 4.01 ( http://www.insecure.org/nmap/ )
	Initiating ARP Ping Scan against 10.0.0.5 [1 port] at 14:35
	The ARP Ping Scan took 0.01s to scan 1 total hosts.
	DNS resolution of 1 IPs took 0.02s. Mode: Async
	[#: 2, OK: 0, NX: 1, DR: 0, SF: 0, TR: 1, CN: 0]
	Initiating SYN Stealth Scan against 10.0.0.5 [1672 ports] at 14:35
	The SYN Stealth Scan took 35.72s to scan 1672 total ports.
	Warning: OS detection will be MUCH less reliable because we did not find at least 1 open and 1 closed TCP port
	Host 10.0.0.5 appears to be up ... good. All 1672 scanned ports on 10.0.0.5 are: filtered
	MAC Address: 00:14:2A:B1:1E:2E (Elitegroup Computer System Co.) Too many fingerprints match this host to give specific OS details

	nmap -sS -P0 -p 1-140 -O -D xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
